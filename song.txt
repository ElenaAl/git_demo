With December comes the glimmer on her face
And I get a bit nervous
I get a bit nervous now
In the twelve months on I won’t make friends with change
When everyone's perfect

Can we start over again?
The playgrounds, they get rusty and your
Heart beats another ten thousand times before
I got the chance to say
I miss you

When it gets hard
I get a little stronger now
I get a little braver now
And when it gets dark
I get a little brighter now
I get a little wiser now
Before I give my heart away
